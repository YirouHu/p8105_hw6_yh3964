# Problem 1

## Section a

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You
can read their accompanying article here.

- Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
  variable indicating whether the homicide is solved.
- Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t
  report victim race.
- Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake.
- For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is
  white or black.
- Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("homicide-data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
          victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |>
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) |>
  drop_na(victim_age)
```

## Section b

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors.

- Save the output of glm as an R object;
- apply the broom::tidy to this object;
- and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds
  ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims
  keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df = homicide_data |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_glm = glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
                     data = baltimore_df, 
                     family = binomial())

baltimore_model_results = baltimore_glm |> 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    lower_ci = exp(conf.low),
    upper_ci = exp(conf.high)
  )

male_female_or = 
  baltimore_model_results |> 
  pull(OR)

male_female_ci_lower =
  baltimore_model_results |> 
  pull(lower_ci) 

male_female_ci_upper = 
  baltimore_model_results |> 
  pull(upper_ci)
```

### Comments

The estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing
male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed is
0.4255117. These results indicate that the odds of having a solved
homicide case for male is approximate 0.43 times the odds for a female.
Furthermore, we are 95% confident that the true estimate is between
(0.3241908, 0.5575508).

## Section c

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims.

Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, list
columns, and unnest as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated
ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
model_glm <- function(df) {
  glm_model = glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = df, family = binomial() )
}

city_results = homicide_data |> 
  nest(data = -city_state) |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(data, model_glm),
    results = map(models, ~broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE))
  ) |> 
  unnest(results) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    lower_ci = exp(conf.low),
    upper_ci = exp(conf.high),
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)
  )
```

    ## Warning: There were 43 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `results = map(models, ~broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE,
    ##   exponentiate = TRUE))`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 42 remaining warnings.

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
city_results_plot =
  city_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = OR, y = city_state)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", size = 1.5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower_ci, xmax = upper_ci), width = 0.25) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted Odds Ratios with CI for Solving Homicides (Male vs Female Victims)",
    x = "Odds Ratio",
    y = "City"
  ) +

### Comments

- For most cities, the ORs are less than 1, suggesting that, there are
  higher odds that a homicide with female will be solved compared to
  male after keeping all other variables fixed.

- The cities at the top of the plot, such as Fresno, CA, and
  Minneapolis, MN, have ORs greater than 1, indicating a relatively
  higher likelihood of solving cases with male victims in these cities.

- For cities like Tulsa, OK, and Nashville, TN, have confidence
  intervals that contain the OR of 1, suggesting that there is no
  statistically significant difference in the likelihood of solving
  homicides between male and female victims in those cities.

- The confidence intervals for cities like Fresno, CA, do not cross 1,
  suggesting a statistically significant difference in the likelihood of
  solving homicides with male victims compared to female victims.

# Problem 2

For this problem, we’ll use the Central Park weather data similar to
data we’ve seen elsewhere. The code chunk below (adapted from the course
website) will download these data.

``` r
data("weather_df")
```

The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a
parameter/ value/ summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a
simple linear regression with `tmax` as the response with `tmin` and
`prcp` as the predictors, and are interested in the distribution of two
quantities estimated from these data:

- $\hat{r}^2$
- $\hat{\beta}_1 / \hat{\beta}_2$

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities.

- Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words.
- Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
  quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for $\hat{r}^2$ and
  $\hat{\beta}_1 / \hat{\beta}_2$.

Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting $\hat{r}^2$ from a
fitted regression, and `broom::tidy()` (with some additional wrangling)
should help in computing $\hat{\beta}_1 / \hat{\beta}_2$.
